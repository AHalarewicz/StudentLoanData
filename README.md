# Predicting a Student's ability to repay their Loan

Capstone Project for Springboard's Data Science Career Track

# Project Description:

The purpose of this project is to predict if a borrower will default on a borrowed Loan. 

This project explores student debt, a borrower's financial standing, and a borrower's ability to repay the loan.

This repository contains all of the elements that exhibit proficient knowledge in the complete data science life cycle.

# Objective:
Train a Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to predict if a Loan will default

# Results:
After correcting class imbalance: 

  The model performs with 71% accuracy
  
  And has a True Positive Rate of 68% when predicting loan default
